## How To Play

Start a New Game: Begin a new game and prepare to uncover the mystery word.

Guess the Word: Guess the letters that you believe are part of the hidden word. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in its respective position(s). If you guess incorrectly, a part of the hangman will be drawn as a penalty.

Word Completion: Your goal is to reveal the entire word before the hangman figure is completed. Make sure to guess the word correctly within a limited number of attempts to win the game.

Strategy and Skill: Use your knowledge of words, common letters, and the context of the game to make educated guesses. Every incorrect guess brings you closer to the hangman's completion!

### Hangman Rules:

You have a set number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
For each incorrect letter guess, a part of the hangman (a stick figure) is drawn.
The game is over if the hangman figure is fully drawn before you guess the word.
You win the game if you guess the word before the hangman is complete.
